# Remove Comments

Remove comments from your code to make it more readable (sometimes)

# Running the script:

Head to your terminal or command prompt

Type py remove_comments.py

Then it will prompt you which file you wish to remove the comments from

_(You must give it the full path)_

Then give it a name to save as so it doesn't overwrite your file.

_(You can use a path for this but you can just type a name and it will save in the working directory)_

# Reason for making this script:

I had made a Neural Net in python with a lot of comments and wished to see it without them.


# Possible future plans:

~~Make a question as to what comments are in users language~~**√**

~~Just get rid of the extension so you can save it as .whatever~~**√**

~~For Java users (where comments are "//") don't get rid of links like: https://...~~

Multi-Line comments?
